# Canvas2image #
a tool of saving or converting canvas to images. It allow also to saveAsImage
with filename defined by you! No longer meaningless browser default 
filenames that may scare some people.

## Demo ##
[canvas2image](http://mbochynski.github.io/canvas2image/index.html)

## Code ##
you can just use it like this
		
    Canvas2Image.saveAsImage(canvasObj, width, height, type, filename, background)
    Canvas2Image.saveAsPNG(canvasObj, width, height, filename, background)
    Canvas2Image.saveAsJPEG(canvasObj, width, height, filename, background)
    Canvas2Image.saveAsGIF(canvasObj, width, height, filename, background)
    Canvas2Image.saveAsBMP(canvasObj, width, height, filename, background)
		- filename should be a string without extension
		- background should be a boolean value - if the canvas before save should be 
		filled with white backgound or not
    
    Canvas2Image.convertToImage(canvasObj, width, height, type)
    Canvas2Image.convertToPNG(canvasObj, widht, height)
    Canvas2Image.convertToJPEG(canvasObj, widht, height)
    Canvas2Image.convertToGIF(canvasObj, widht, height)
    Canvas2Image.convertToBMP(canvasObj, widht, height)

## Supported browsers ##

I have tested this new feature (custom filename) with following browsers:
- Opera 12.16 1860 NOK
- Google Chrome 34.0.1847.132 OK
- Mozilla Firefox 29.0 OK

More (IE) will be tested soon.

- NOK => everything seems to be working but saved with browser default filename
- OK => everything seems to be working fine
